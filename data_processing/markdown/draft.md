# Interpretable Random Forest for Clinical Prediction: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Abstract
**Background:** Machine learning models for clinical prediction often lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in healthcare settings. While random forests achieve high predictive accuracy, their ensemble nature makes them inherently opaque.

**Objective:** To develop and validate an interpretable random forest approach that maintains high predictive performance while providing clinically meaningful explanations.

**Methods:** [Brief methodology overview - cross-validation, calibration, interpretation techniques]

**Results:** 
- Model achieved AUC of 0.954 (95% CI: 0.952-0.956) with consistent performance across 50 random seeds
- Test R² of 0.940 with validation R² of 0.915 across 4-fold cross-validation
- Uncalibrated model showed excellent probability alignment (R² 0.926-0.967 with surrogate model)
- Feature importance analysis revealed [key clinical predictors]

**Conclusions:** The interpretable random forest framework successfully balances predictive accuracy with clinical interpretability, demonstrating robust performance suitable for clinical deployment.
