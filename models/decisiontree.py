Decision Tree Surrogate Model for Lung Cancer MLP Analysis

This module implements a decision tree classifier that serves as an interpretable 
surrogate model for the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) implemented in 
class_based_models/lung_cancer_mlp.py. The primary purpose is to analyze and 
understand the black-box behavior of the deep learning model through transparent 
decision tree predictions.

Surrogate Model Approach:
The decision tree is trained to mimic the predictions of the trained MLP model,
providing interpretable insights into how the neural network makes decisions.
This white-box approach allows clinicians and researchers to understand the 
decision-making process that would otherwise be opaque in the MLP.

Key Features:
- Patient-grouped cross-validation to prevent data leakage
- Decision tree trained on MLP predictions rather than true labels
- SHAP analysis for feature importance and decision path visualization
- Model fidelity assessment to ensure surrogate accuracy
- Comprehensive tree visualization and rule extraction
- SMOTEENN resampling for balanced surrogate training
- Reproducible results with fixed random seeds

Surrogate Model Benefits:
1. Interpretability: Provides clear decision rules and feature thresholds
2. Validation: Helps verify that MLP decisions are medically reasonable
3. Feature Analysis: Identifies key biomarkers driving predictions
4. Clinical Translation: Offers explainable AI for medical decision support
5. Model Debugging: Reveals potential biases or errors in MLP behavior

Dependencies:
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computations
- scikit-learn: Decision tree implementation and evaluation metrics
- matplotlib: Tree visualization and plotting
- imbalanced-learn: Handling class imbalance with SMOTEENN
- shap: Model interpretability and feature importance analysis

Data Requirements:
The surrogate model expects 'data/surrogate_data.csv' containing:
- Feature columns: Same features used to train the original MLP
- predicted_label: MLP predictions to be mimicked by the surrogate
- true_label: Original ground truth labels for validation
- patient_id: Patient identifiers for grouped cross-validation
- segment: Data segment identifiers

Usage:
    python models/decisiontree.py

The script trains decision tree surrogates using 4-fold cross-validation,
evaluates surrogate fidelity to the MLP, and generates interpretability
visualizations including tree plots and SHAP analysis.
