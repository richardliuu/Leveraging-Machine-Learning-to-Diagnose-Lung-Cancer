# Leveraging Machine Learning to Diagnose Lung Cancer through Audio Classification

- Machine Learning

- Stack multiple layers to help filter out specific features and increase accuracy
- Can be done through implementing multiple types of neural networks and such


Main Limitations
- Trying to find a training dataset and learning how to add multiple layers 

- need to do research on how to stack multiple layers
