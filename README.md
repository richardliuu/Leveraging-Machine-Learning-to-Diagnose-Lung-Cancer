# Interpretable Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Voice Biomarkers

## üéØ Project Overview

This project presents a novel machine learning approach for lung cancer diagnosis using voice biomarkers, with a unique focus on **interpretable AI through surrogate modeling**. The system combines the high accuracy of deep neural networks with the transparency of decision trees, providing clinicians with both reliable predictions and understandable explanations.

### Key Innovation: Dual-Model Interpretability Framework

- **Primary Model**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for high-accuracy lung cancer stage classification
- **Surrogate Model**: Decision Tree trained to mimic MLP predictions while providing interpretable decision rules
- **SHAP Analysis**: Feature importance comparison between both models for validation and clinical insight

## üè• Clinical Significance

Lung cancer can cause subtle changes in voice patterns due to effects on the respiratory system. This project investigates whether machine learning models can detect such changes using features extracted from speech recordings, offering a **non-invasive, accessible screening approach**.

### Why Voice-Based Screening?
- **Non-invasive**: No physical procedures required
- **Accessible**: Can be performed remotely with basic recording equipment  
- **Early Detection**: Potential to identify subtle vocal changes before clinical symptoms
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimal infrastructure requirements for widespread deployment

## üß† Novel Interpretability Approach

### The Challenge
Traditional deep learning models for medical diagnosis are "black boxes" - highly accurate but difficult for clinicians to understand and trust.

### Solution
I implemented a **surrogate model framework** where:

1. **MLP Model** (`class_based_models/lung_cancer_mlp.py`): Trained on voice biomarkers for optimal accuracy
2. **Decision Tree Surrogate** (`models/decisiontree.py`): Trained to replicate MLP predictions using interpretable rules
3. **Comparative SHAP Analysis**: Feature importance validation across both models
4. **Clinical Translation**: Provides explainable decision pathways for medical professionals

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Models Implemented

#### 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Purpose**: Primary classification model for lung cancer staging
- **Architecture**: Deep neural network with batch normalization and dropout
- **Features**: Rigorous cross-validation, SMOTEENN resampling, early stopping
- **Interpretability**: SHAP analysis for feature importance

#### 2. Decision Tree Surrogate  
- **Purpose**: Interpretable proxy model mimicking MLP behavior
- **Training**: Learns to predict MLP outputs rather than ground truth labels
- **Benefits**: Provides transparent decision rules and feature thresholds
- **Validation**: Fidelity assessment ensures surrogate accuracy

#### 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Purpose**: Performance comparison baseline for architectural decision-making
- **Input**: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients from voice recordings
- **Architecture**: Convolutional layers for spatial pattern recognition in spectral features
- **Role**: Evaluated against MLP to determine optimal architecture for the project

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Decision: Why MLP Over CNN?

After comprehensive evaluation of both architectures, the **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was selected as the primary model** for this lung cancer classification task. This decision was based on several key factors:

#### Performance Comparison Results
- **MLP Advantages**:
  - Superior classification accuracy on tabular voice biomarker features
  - More stable training convergence with fewer hyperparameter sensitivities
  - Better handling of the heterogeneous feature set (spectral, prosodic, and temporal features)
  - Lower computational overhead for equivalent performance levels

#### Technical Rationale
- **Feature Nature**: Voice biomarkers are primarily tabular numerical features rather than spatial/sequential patterns
- **Data Efficiency**: MLPs require fewer parameters to achieve comparable performance on this feature set
- **Interpretability**: SHAP analysis works more effectively with MLP architectures for clinical interpretation

#### CNN Limitations for This Task
- **Spatial Assumptions**: CNNs excel at spatial pattern recognition, but voice biomarkers don't exhibit strong spatial relationships
- **Overparameterization**: CNN's convolutional filters may be unnecessarily complex for tabular feature data

#### Clinical Deployment Considerations
- **Efficiency**: MLPs enable faster inference times for real-time screening applications
- **Interpretability**: Simpler architecture facilitates better clinical understanding and trust

The CNN implementation remains valuable as a **performance baseline** and demonstrates the systematic approach used for architectural selection in this medical AI system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Disclaimers

### Research Purpose Only
This work is intended for **research and prototyping purposes only**. It is not approved for clinical use and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis without proper validation and regulatory approval.

### Technical Limitations
1. **Dataset Size**: Limited to available voice recordings from single institution
2. **Surrogate Fidelity**: Interpretable model may not capture all MLP complexity  
3. **Generalizability**: Performance may vary across different populations and recording conditions
4. **Feature Engineering**: Voice biomarker extraction may miss relevant patterns
5. **Bias**: The dataset provides bias to the model, as only 2 classes need to be identified. In deployment, that may not be the case. 

### Clinical Considerations
- Voice changes can result from many conditions beyond lung cancer
- Model predictions should supplement, not replace, clinical judgment
- Requires validation on larger, more diverse patient populations
- Need for longitudinal studies to assess temporal stability

### Future Work
- Expanding dataset size to provide model with a larger demographic 
- Improve model architecture to improve model accuracy
- Implementing more explainability tools to enhance human interpretability of the model
