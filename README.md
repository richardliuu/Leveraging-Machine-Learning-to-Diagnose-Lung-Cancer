# Introduction 
This repostiroy contains the code for a proof-of-concept machine learning model that detects potential signs of lung cancer using audio recordings of human speech. It explores the relationship between vocal biomakers and health conditions like lung cancer, offering a non-invasive approach to voice-based screening. 

# Project Overview 
Lung cancer can cause subtle changes in voice due to effects on the respiratory system. This project investigates whether machine learning models can detect such changes using features extracted from speech. 

This work is intended for research and prototyping purposes only. 

# Models Used 
MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
- Tabular features for classification

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) 
- For MFCC-based (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) spectrogram inputs

# Methodology 

# Getting Started 
1. Clone the repository
2. Download dependencies
